    WARNING! 
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    This script is designed for Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (8.0) but your 
    database is set up for compatibility with version ' 
    + CAST(@DBCompatibilityLevelMajor AS NVARCHAR(80)) 
    + N'.' 
    + CAST(@DBCompatibilityLevelMinor AS NVARCHAR(80)) 
    + N'. Although 
    the script should work with later versions of Microsoft SQL Server, 
    you can ensure compatibility by executing the following statement:
    
    ALTER DATABASE [' 
    + DB_NAME() 
    + N'] 
    SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 80

    If you are hosting ELMAH in the same database as your application 
    database and do not wish to change the compatibility option then you 
    should create a separate database to host ELMAH where you can set the 
    compatibility level more freely.
    
    If you continue with the current setup, please report any compatibility 
    issues you encounter over at:
    
    http://code.google.com/p/elmah/issues/list
